__Handwritten digit recognition is a classic machine learning problem where the goal is to correctly identify digits (0â€“9) from images.
This project uses:

MNIST Dataset: A standard benchmark dataset of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (28x28 pixels).

CNN Model: Built using deep learning layers such as convolution, pooling, and fully connected layers.

Streamlit Web App: An interactive interface allowing users to upload an image of a digit and receive instant predictions.
